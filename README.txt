1. I have tried to get the desired result using WebGL.
2. I have choosen Inkscape tool to design 3d object (house).
3. I have added bumpiness to walls using bricks and other textures (Bump Mapping).
4. I have made roof look shiny using tiles (Environment Mapping).
5. I have applied textures mapping for other parts of house like Windows, chimney etc.

I have choosen InkScape tool since it is easy to use and it creates objects in SVG. It has a drawback of not having rotation feature
but I felt rotation is not necessary since main aim to the assignment is to create texture mapping. It provides a good features to create
different textures.
